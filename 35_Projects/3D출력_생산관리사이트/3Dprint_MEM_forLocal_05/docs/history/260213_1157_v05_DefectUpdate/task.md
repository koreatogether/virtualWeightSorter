# Task: Defect Management & Past Date Access

## Planning
- [x] Research date restriction logic in `main.js` <!-- id: 5 -->
- [x] Research performance input and defect handling in `app.py` and `main.js` <!-- id: 6 -->
- [x] Design data schema update for defects <!-- id: 7 -->
- [x] Create implementation plan <!-- id: 8 -->

## Execution
- [x] Unlock past dates in date picker <!-- id: 9 -->
- [x] Add "Defect" button and modal to the UI <!-- id: 10 -->
- [x] Implement backend API for recording defects <!-- id: 11 -->
- [x] Update filament consumption and order status calculations to include defects <!-- id: 12 -->
- [x] Fix filament consumption logic to use production date (start_time) <!-- id: 16 -->

## Verification
- [x] Verify past date selection <!-- id: 13 -->
- [x] Test defect input and its impact on totals <!-- id: 14 -->
- [x] Verify filament consumption accuracy with defects <!-- id: 15 -->
